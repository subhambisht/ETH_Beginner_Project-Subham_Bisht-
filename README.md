# Create a Token

'PERSONAL_TOKEN' a token for a smart contract for transactions.

## Description

The aim of this contract is to manage the "PERSONAL_TOKEN" token, abbreviated as "ETH". It oversees the minting and burning processes, enabling the creation and management of tokens. The contract monitors the total token supply, as well as the addresses and their corresponding token balances. Users can mint new tokens to boost their balance and the overall supply, provided they have enough tokens to burn, or they can burn tokens to reduce both their balance and the total supply.

## Executing program

* Copy the code and paste it on remix.etherum.org
* Make sure it is compatible with the current version of the compiler
* Compile the code (or press 'ctrl + S' for compilation)
* Deploy the contract (Compile and Deploy options are on the left side of the screen)
* Use the deployed contract as per your wish.

## Help

Make sure the contract is compatible with the current version of your compiler. (>=0.8.7 is common)
